Defensive? Ecto updates
=======================

Ecto is a brilliant database ORM for Elixir. This post is about something
that bothers me when reading code using Ecto.

Frequently, I encounter code similar to the following.
```
changeset = generate_changeset(however, you, want)
if changeset.valid? do
  MyModel.update!(changeset)
end
```

And I discovered Ecto's own docs are peppered with this pattern. However this
feels as if it is against Joe Armstrong's advice and Erlang's philosophy, to
just let things crash.

Why not write this?
```
changeset = generate_changeset(however, you, want)
MyModel.update(changeset)
```

The code I am most acquainted with at work does all database interactions
on a best effort basis. Besides logging, failures are ignored.
That might seem reckless, but frankly, it is the simplest and most sensible
option in some situations, it is part of the tradeoffs.

What, if any are the differences between these two when used purely for side
effect?

### Down the rabbit hole

Let us look at [the source for default implementation of `update!`][1].
It is embedded here for convinience.

[ghembedder:elixir-lang/ecto@v1.0.7:lib/ecto/repo/model.ex#21-30]

The default implementation delegates to the non-bang version and raises if
an error tuple is returned.

If we continue reading to find the non-bang versions of `insert`, `update`,
`delete`, we find that they invoke `do_*` versions, `do_insert`, `do_update`,
`do_delete`.  These return an error tuple only when a constraint violation is
encountered, or if the changeset is invalid.

Importantly, [this snippet][2] from ecto source shows that database access is not
performed when the changeset is invalid, so it is not required to guard your
code defensively.

[ghembedder:elixir-lang/ecto@v1.0.7:lib/ecto/repo/model.ex#168-170]

If you think about it, that is both brilliant and obvious. Ofcourse it should be
that way, there's no other sensible implementation.

### When to use one vs the other?

There is only one situation in which I would personally prefer the bang
variants over their counterparts.

If a database constraint error occours and it can not be handled locally, and it
is required to propogate the error elsewhere, use the bang variant. Omit the
`if changeset.valid?` if model validation failures should be treated the same.

If there is no way to proceed when model validations succeed but database
constraints fail, the `if changeset.valid?, do: update!` pattern should be used.
If it is followed by an else block, my first reaction would be to rewrite it as
a case statement.

In any other case, use `update` and friends coupled with a case statement if
necessary.

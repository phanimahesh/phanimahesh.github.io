Hi
==

```sh
jpm@dev.phanimahesh.me:~$ whoami

jpm
# I'm J Phani Mahesh.
# I love using code to solve* interesting* problems.
#  *For some definition of solve and interesting.


jpm@dev.phanimahesh.me:~$ groups
dev sysadm hackers polyglots architects foss-enthusiasts ...
# A polyglot developer who is a hacker at heart,
#  free (as in free speech) and open source software enthusiast.
```

I like to think I have *some* idea what I am doing.

When I'm not coding, mostly, I'm either eating, sleeping, reading,
or having fun with friends, board games, puzzles and philosophy.

Currently working for [Apinf](http://apinf.org/)
